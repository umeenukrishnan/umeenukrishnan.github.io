I am a kind of girl who love to express and easily get motivated in  life by my own thoughts. Its very important for me to write my experience and learnings somewhere, so that I can learn from it in the later stage. I am basically a research scholar at Civil engineering department, IIT Roorkee. 

My vision towards life changed after joining in this institute, not because of this institute, but I think its because of my team, each and every lab member is one of a kind. I learned many things and I was lucky enough to join this lab specifically. One of my senior  more like my elder brother guided me and helped me to solve almost all my problems. 

Yes you got me right, he suggested me about this platform and I was excited to make use of this new platform. Thus I have decided to make use of this platform to share my learnings to the rest of the world.
