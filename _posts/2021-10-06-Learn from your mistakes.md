I always feel that there is nothing better than working in a team. It has many advantages, but it also comes up with great responsibility, I would say. When we are working as a team, it becomes everyone's responsibility to save and store the data efficiently because it is usually shared with multiple team members. Earlier, we were using Dropbox to share the data, and it was pretty efficient. Still, one day, because of the storage issue, I deleted some of the documents from a shared folder, and the important point to be noted that whenever we delete any file from a shared folder the file gets deleted from all the other team members dropbox as well... and the scary part is I was not aware of this. Dropbox has also removed the retrieve functionality from the free version. So there will be no option left to retrieve the files. This can lead to a major disaster I would say so it is better to shift to GitHub. 
GitHub is an open-source which helps to host multiple repositories that will include equal access control to multiple collaborators. Git is a version control system that will allow collaborators to keep complete track of each and every change made in the repository. 

Some of the points you should be proud of when you are working with GitHub :


* To be very honest, every open source project uses GitHub to maintain its repositories. Each repo will have a readme file that will give an overall idea about the repository.

* You should always make a habit of committing. When you start to work with a  new project, do the initial commit, then commit with each change you made in the repository. 

* Github will allow us to showcase your work and share it with multiple collaborators, and it becomes effortless to track each change and get the answers to the following questions:

  * Who made the changes?
  * When did the change occur?
  * Where did the change occur?

* You can also download GitHub desktop to have an updated track on your repository. 

* It becomes effortless to get the Backup of all the projects you are working on.

* You can get access from anywhere at any time. Just you need the internet facility. 


So yes, what are you waiting for? Make use of GitHub to the fullest and make your life easier.
