Latex is an efficient tool for writing. Latex does the majority of formatting on its own. Sometimes our document has a lot of figures and tables and becomes difficult to manage and in this situation, we can use this single package which will make your life much easier. 

* Use the package in the preamble section of the Latex document.

  ```latex
  \usepackage{here}
  ```

* #### Then the syntax for adding the figure is given below. 

  ```latex
  \begin{figure}[htbp]
      \centering
      \includegraphics{figure_name.pdf}
      \caption{abc}
      \label{fig:a}
  \end{figure}
  ```

* You need to add [htbp] after \begin{figure} command, where  "htbp stands for Here To Be Placed."

* If you want this functionality to be used for tables then  add [htbp] after \begin{Table} command

Hope this solves some of your problems.
