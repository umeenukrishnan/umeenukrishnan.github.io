Daily we come across many new things.  We learn from everything and it is very difficult to store everything in your mind. Also I believe it is very important to share your learnings with other fellows. So for this as a solution I try to journal or make short videos. In this article I will share the steps and tools which I follow for making videos. 

- Step 1 : First and very important step is scripting. Take a pen and just write it down what you want to document. I usually use <u>Notion</u> to make revise the script and finalise the script. 

- Step 2 : Next step is to make visual representation of your script. Depending on the requirement I  go for power point presentation, or any pictorial representation (flowcharts, bar diagrams etc.).

- Step 3 : Third step is to record your voice. For this purpose I use <u>Audacity</u> to record the voice. For editing I follow this four easy steps to enhance the quality of my recording. 

  - Whenever you are starting with your recording, just record the silence for first 5 seconds, so that the additional noise can be recorded then record your audio. 

  - Go to Effect --- Noise Reduction. First follow the step 1 to Get Noise Profile, then select the initial 5 seconds of the audio. Then go to step 2 and do the following settings. 

    ​		Noise reduction : 12 dB

    ​		Sensitivity : 6.00

    ​		Frequency smoothing : 3

    ​		Noise :  Reduce

  - The next step is to select the complete audio and Go to Effect --- Compressor and fix the threshold to -18.
  - Next step is to Go to Effect --- Limiter --- Change the type to Hard Limiter. And fix the hard limiter level to -4 dB.
  - The last step is to Go to Effect --- Normalize. And Fix the Normalize peak amplitude to -1.0 dB

- Step 4 : Next step is to screen record the video in synchrony with the audio we have recorded in the previous step. 

- Step 5 : Last step is to merge the audio recorded and the screen recorded video. I use iMovie to do the same. 

That's it friends you are goood to go now. 

All the best :)
